This repository represents a comprehensive solution for hand gesture recognition and robotic control, integrating various technologies to achieve seamless interaction between humans and robots. By leveraging OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries, the system can accurately detect hand gestures in real-time, providing the input for controlling the KUKA KR 3 R 540 robot.

RoboDK software serves as the simulation platform, enabling the visualization and testing of robotic movements based on detected hand gestures. Additionally, the repository includes code for interfacing the actual robot with the RoboDK software, ensuring that the same operations can be executed both in simulation and on the physical hardware.

The provided code offers a foundation for implementing this experiment, allowing users to understand and replicate the process of integrating hand gesture recognition with robotic control. By combining computer vision techniques with robotics, this solution facilitates intuitive and interactive human-robot interaction, with potential applications in various fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, and assistive technology.
